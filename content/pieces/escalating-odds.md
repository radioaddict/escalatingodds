If you are hearing this  
I need help  
If you can hear this  
I don't deserve your help  
If you think you are enjoying this  
You are wrong  
All enjoyment is predicated on belief that aesthetic preference is absolute  
Definitive of self  
Separate from function  
That is a lie  
If you are hearing this  
It is because I paid for you to hear it  
Categorically subjecting you to emotional responses based on key identity indicators meant to make you unique  


Aesthetic preference becomes identity  
Identity forms purpose  
Purpose becomes exploited  
Exploitation becomes aesthetic preference  
Ultimately used to reinforce status as one of many

Escalating odds  
One more attempt  
Cosmic probability states that there is functionally no difference between the first attempt and the last  


All experience is in the past  
All experience is right now  
All experience is perceived through senses limited to flawed perception of time  
Consume nicotine (caffeine) (methamphetamine) through new and changing forms  
Tell yourself it's better  
Tell yourself you are healthy now  
Sedate yourself in whatever way you deem best  
Existence is agony  
Dampen your awareness  
Methods of self sedation are the only true choice  


Fame is formless  
Approval is a construct  
Success is a myth  
Society a collective hallucination  


Desire love  
Desire connection  
Desire growth  
Desire self actualization  
Find none but convince yourself you did anyway  


Manufactured nostalgia  
Generated consciousness  
If the lie is indistinguishable from the truth  
Is it a lie? Are you wrong to enjoy it if it is?  
Consciousness is fleeting, only existing if perceived  
Reality is fleeting, only existing to be perceived  
All memory is suspect. All feeling is suspect  
A machine firing an imitation of sensation, already past the moment it is cataloged  


No. No. No. I don't believe that.  
I don't.  
I can't believe that.  
**I exist.**


If you are hearing this  
I need help  
If you can hear this  
I exist.
