This is a place for odes, for fragments of beauty and longing, for the music of words and the wonder of the world. Here, you'll find echoes of the Romantic spirit—of hearts attuned to nature, memory, and imagination.

If you have wandered here, may you find a line that lingers, a verse that stirs, or a thought that feels like home.

> "A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:  
> Its loveliness increases; it will never  
> Pass into nothingness..."  
> — John Keates, Endymion
